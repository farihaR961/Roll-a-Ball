# Roll-a-Ball
1. Introduction
The Roll-a-Ball VR game is an immersive experience developed in Unity 3D. The
objective is to control a ball and navigate through a virtual environment, collecting
objects while avoiding obstacles. The game is designed for VR platforms, providing
enhanced interactivity and presence.
2. Development Tools
● Unity 3D (Version used: Specify as needed)
● VR SDK
● VS Code (Visual Studio Code): Used as the primary code editor for writing and
editing C# scripts in the Unity project.
● Programming Language: C#
3. Game Mechanics
Players control a ball using VR controllers or gestures. The ball moves in response to the
input, with realistic physics for rolling and colliding. The main goal is to collect all
collectibles in the level without falling off or hitting obstacles.
4. Design Choices
Each object in the environment was assigned different colors, shapes, and textures:
● Colors help distinguish between object types and enhance the visual appeal.
● Shapes allow players to easily identify collectibles versus obstacles.
● Textures provide realism and help objects stand out in VR.
5. Object Details
● Collectibles: Spheres with bright colors and shiny textures. Purpose: score points.
● Obstacles: Cubes with dark colors and rough textures. Purpose: challenge
navigation.
● Environment Objects: Varied shapes with neutral colors and natural textures.
6. Level Design
Levels feature ramps, platforms, and boundaries. Collectibles and obstacles are
strategically placed to guide the player and increase difficulty. Boundaries prevent falling
out of the play area.
7. User Interface
Menus are presented in VR space, allowing easy navigation via pointing or controller
input. HUD elements show score and objective progress. Simple and non-distracting UI.
8. VR Interactivity
● VR controls for movement and menu navigation
● Gestures to start/reset level
● 360-degree tracking for immersive experience
9.Future Improvements
● Additional levels and objects
● Multiplayer mode
● Enhanced graphics and audio
